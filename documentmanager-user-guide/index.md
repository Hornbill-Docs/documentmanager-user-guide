# Welcome

Document Manager runs on the Hornbill platform and allows users to manage documents of various types. You can upload, create, share, and collaborate on documents in Document Manager. You can add published documents to one or more libraries, which can be available to other Document Manager users. Administrators can install Document Manager from the App Store.

## Searching

Use the Global Search option to find documents you own or have access to.

* **Search by Tag**: Use this option to find documents that have specific tags.
* **Search by Title / Description**: Use this option to find documents based on search terms that match with the title and/or description of documents.

## Plug-ins to other apps

A very powerful aspect to Hornbill is the ability of the different applications to work together. Some of the available plug-ins between Document Manager and other Hornbill apps are:

* **Service Manager**: When viewing and working on requests in Service Manager, use the Document action item to search for and link documents to requests.
* **Customer Manager**: When viewing Organization records and or Service Contracts, use the Document option to search for and link documents to organizations and service contracts.
* **Project Manager**: When viewing Projects in Project Manager, use the Documents option to search for and link documents to projects.
* **iBridge**: Automate the linking of documents to other entities on Hornbill as part of business processes. For example, link a document to a request in Service Manager
